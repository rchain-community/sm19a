## Background

Whereas Barry Cynamon, Mark Pui, and Kevin Goldstein served with distinction on the RChain Cooperative board, let us thank them for their service. I (@dckc) propose to chair an RChain Cooperative Special meeting with this and other matters I may add to the agenda in the coming week or two.

_The [proposal in the #governance channel at 23:52 UTC Fri Apr 26][652] received endorsement from over 100 members; i.e. 10% of the membership._
