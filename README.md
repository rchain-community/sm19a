# RChain Special Meeting Proposal 19A

The meeting was in Apr 2019, but some work on the
[sm19a issues](https://github.com/rchain-community/sm19a/issues) continues.

RChain continues to host discussion in channels such as [#members][mem], [#governance][gov].

## Timeline, topics

The [proposal in the #governance channel at 23:52 UTC Fri Apr 26][652] received endorsement from over 100 members; i.e. 10% of the membership:

> Whereas Barry Cynamon, Mark Pui, and Kevin Goldstein served with distinction on the RChain Cooperative board, let us thank them for their service. I (@dckc) propose to chair an RChain Cooperative Special meeting with this and other matters I may add to the agenda in the coming week or two.

The [sm19a meeting notes slides][meeting-notes-sm19a] serve as a rough agenda. We also had [shared notes][meeting-notes-sm19a] on some of the sessions. _Note archived copies in the `records` directory._
